\unnumberedsection{Methodology}\label{methodology}

To prepare this report, we interviewed about a dozen
Mozilla-affiliated people with diverse views on open source across a
range of Mozilla initiatives and products.  Initially, those
interviews focused on a few Mozilla efforts (Firefox, Rust, and
Servo), but eventually they grew to include discussions of many Mozilla
efforts and delved into policy beyond just open source.  We also drew
on examinations of open source projects unaffiliated with Mozilla; we
initiated some of those examinations specifically for this report, and
had already done others as part of previous research efforts.

\unnumberedsection{Acknowledgements}\label{acknowledgements}

We are grateful to all of the interviewees at Mozilla who gave
generously of their time and expertise.  We have not named them here,
in part because some asked not to be named (in order to speak
frankly), and in part because each archetype should stand on its own
and not be associated with any particular person.
