\unnumberedsection{Contributors and Archetypes: Setting Expectations}\label{contributor-expectations}

Knowing a project's archetype helps to answer an important question:

\begin{adjustwidth}{3em}{3em}
\emph{How much, and in what ways, should we invest in attracting,
  onboarding, and working with contributors?}
\end{adjustwidth}

Setting contributor expectations accurately is one of the best moves a
project can make.  For example, an open source project is not
obligated to be Wide Open (\fullref{archetype:wide-open}), but it
should avoid accidentally misrepresenting itself as Wide Open if it's
not going to provide the kind of contributor support that a Wide Open
project would normally provide.  Potential contributors want to see
what they're getting into before they invest significant effort.  The
more clearly a project provides such information up front, the easier
it is for suitable contributors to find their way in and, equally
importantly, for unsuitable ones to self-select out.

Here are some of the questions developers typically have regarding
participation in an open source project:

\begin{itemize}
  \item I'm considering contributing.  What's the typical onboarding
    path?  How far can a third party contributor go?
  \item I am a new contributor.  How much influence should I expect to
    have in this project, if I continue contributing at my current
    level?  What about if I start contributing more frequently or more
    substantially?
  \item I am part of the maintainance team.  How much time should I
    expect to spend mentoring new contributors?
\end{itemize}

In \fullref{appdx-contribution-templates} we give some examples of how
a project might express expectations clearly to contributors, and
offers some suggestions for where to publish such language.
