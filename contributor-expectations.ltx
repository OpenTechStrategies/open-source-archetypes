\unnumberedsection{Contributors and Archetypes: Setting Expectations}\label{contributor-expectations}

Knowing a project's archetype helps to answer an important question:

\begin{adjustwidth}{3em}{3em}
\emph{How much, and in what ways, should we invest in attracting,
  onboarding, and working with contributors?}
\end{adjustwidth}

Setting contributor expectations accurately is one of the best moves a
project can make.  For example, an open source project is not
obligated to be \fullref{archetype:wide-open}, but it
should avoid accidentally misrepresenting itself as Wide Open if it's
not going to provide the kind of contributor support that a Wide Open
project would normally provide.  Potential contributors want to see
what they're getting into before they invest significant effort.  The
more clearly a project provides such information up front, the easier
it is for suitable contributors to find their way in and, equally
importantly, for unsuitable ones to self-select out.

Here are some of the questions developers typically have regarding
participation in an open source project:

\begin{itemize}
  \item I'm considering contributing.  What's the typical onboarding
    path?  How far can a third party contributor go?
  \item I am a new contributor.  How much influence should I expect to
    have in this project, if I continue contributing at my current
    level?  What about if I start contributing more frequently or more
    substantially?
  \item I am part of the maintainance team.  How much time should I
    expect to spend mentoring new contributors?
\end{itemize}

Where each project puts the answers to such questions will vary, but a
typical place might be in a section called
``\texttt{\textbf{Contribution Expectations}}'' in the project's
\texttt{README.md} or \texttt{CONTRIBUTING.md} file.  The exact
language will vary from project to project.  Here is an example for a
project with the ``Rocket Ship to Mars'' archetype:

\begin{verbatim}
## Contribution Expectations

 This project is currently focused on high-velocity development toward
 a very specific goal: <summarize goal in one sentence here>.

 We welcome patches with bug fixes, and we're happy to answer
 questions if you've already put in some effort to find the answer
 yourself.  Please note, however, that we're unlikely to consider new
 feature contributions unless there's a strong argument that the
 proposed feature is fully in line with our stated goals.  If you're
 not sure, please feel free to ask.

 Our technical scope and project governance may open up later, of
 course, especially after we release version 1.0.  For now, though, we
 would characterize this project as being an example of the "Rocket
 Ship to Mars" archetype (see <URL here> for details about RStM and
 other open source archetypes).
