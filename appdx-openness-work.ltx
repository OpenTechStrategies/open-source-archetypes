\unnumberedsection{Appendix E: Work On ``Openness'' At Mozilla}\label{appdx-openness}

In 2017, Mozilla's Open Innovation team completed a thorough review of

and technology work (``Open by Design''), and the need for a report
such as this was one of the findings.  More information about this
previous review can be found at
