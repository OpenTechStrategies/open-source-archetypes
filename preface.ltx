\unnumberedsection{Preface}\label{preface}

This report was originally commissioned by the Mozilla Corporation for
internal purposes.  Mozilla wanted a shared framework for discussing
its options in running open source projects, and requested a survey
and comparative analysis of open source project archetypes --- the
various shapes that open source projects take in order to meet their
various goals.  For example, should a project prioritize development
momentum over early collaborator acquisition, or \foreignphrase{vice
  versa}?  Should it optimize for individual contributors or for
institutional partners?  Different projects will have different
answers to these and many other questions.

The benefits of having a common vocabulary of archetypes extend beyond
Mozilla, however, and the vocabulary is more useful and more easily
improvable the more widely it is shared.  Accordingly, Mozilla decided
to release the report publicly.  Very little has been changed from the
original internal version: the Mozilla-specific orientation has been
left intact, on the theory that the analysis will be clearer if tuned
to a specific (and fortunately well-known) organization rather than
rewritten for a hypothetical general audience.

\emph{TBD: Talk about the changes from version 1 to version 2.}

We emphasize that this will always be a work in progress.  There may
be important archetypes we have not thought of, and for the archetypes
we have identified there may be important properties not discussed
here.  We intend this report to be part of a larger conversation about
open source project archetypes.
