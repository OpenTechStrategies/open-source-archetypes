\unnumberedsection{Signs of Health: Metrics and Archetypes}\label{metrics-archetypes}

The purpose of metrics, in the context of the archetypes, is to tell
you whether your investments are having the desired effect.

Metrics are only meaningful when you start from your
goals\footnote{See section \fullref{goals}, p. \pageref{goals}}.  What
are you trying to maximize, what is your investment so far, and are
you seeing the kinds of results you want?  It's rarely a question of
``Are we doing a good job or a bad job?''.  Rather, it's ``How can we
do a better job?''

For example, your goal is to create an ecosystem that spans an
industry, with a Multi-Vendor Infrastructure project, then an
important metric to watch is what companies are contributing to the
project --- not just who, but the frequency and depth of their
involvement, how often organizations work with each other as peers
(without the founding organization's involvement), etc.

Compare that with a Wide Open project, where long-term stability is a
key goal.  There, signals of health would be diversity of
contributors, reduction in onboarding time, rate of non-employee
contribution, etc.  If one of your goals in the project is to use open
source involvement to develop a hiring pipeline for new talent, that
could affect how you approach onboarding: a broad shallow pool may be
good enough.  Broad and deep sounds even better of course, but it also
takes more investment and may not be worth the cost.

The point of metrics is not to \emph{identify} the archetype --- an
archetype is more a target one aims for than a reality one discovers
--- but to tell if the project is succeeding at its goals.  A
secondary purpose is to get advance notice of forces that may cause
the project to evolve from one archetype to another.  If you're
expecting certain metrics but seeing different ones, it could indicate
that the project is transitioning to, or possibly from, some other
archetype.\footnote{See \fullref{transitions},
  p. \pageref{transitions}.}  Whether this is desirable or not depends
on your goals.

Because archetypes overlap, and because a given metric usually applies
to multiple archetypes, we treat metrics as their own unified topic
here, rather than organizing them by archetype.  The combinatorics of
looking at every archetype with every metric are prohibitive, so we
will just mention the archetypes for which a metric is especially
relevant.

These metrics below are in no particular order, and are intended to be
used creatively --- it might be that, for your particular project,
variations of some of these would be most useful:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Ratio of one-off inquirers to repeat inquirers.

    For Mass Market, expect very high; for Wide Open, expect high.

  \item Duration of organizational participation, and ``weight'' (of
    contribution and influence) per organization.  Duration might need
    to be measured relative to market cycles.

    (B2B)

  \item Ratio of large change requests to small / one-off change requests.

    (B2B)

  \item Ratio of organizationally-motivated changes to
    individually-motivated ones.

    (B2B, Multi-Vendor Infrastructure)

  \item Existence of customized forks / vendor branches.

    (B2B)

  \item Rate of conversion of bug reporters to code contributors.

    (Specialty Library, Controlled Ecosystem, Upstream Dependency)

  \item Frequency of appearance as topic of conference presentations,
    hackathons, etc.

    (B2B)

  \item Ratio of lead-organization contributors to external contributors.

    (B2B and Multi-Vendor Infrastructure, but note that one should
    expect different ratios for those two different archetypes)

  \item Ubiquity of use within a defined industry area.

    (B2B)

  \item Packaging by OS distros; frequency of being offered as a
    pre-defined add-on by cloud vendors.

    (Multi-Vendor Infrastructure, maybe B2B)

  \item Migration of functionality from core to plugins (this is a
    special case of increasing modularization)

    (Controlled Ecosystem)

  \item Frequency with which a representative from the lead
    organization (``Benevolent Dictator Organization'' / ``BDO'')
    participates in discussion, especially with respect to discussions
    that lead toward a decision.  Look at both ratio across all
    discussions and ratio within each discussion thread.  By
    ``discussions'' here, we include issue tracker threads.

    For B2B, RStM, Upstream Dependency, and Trusted Vendor, this
    frequency should be high.

    For Controlled Ecosystem, same, but only for core development, not
    for plugins.

    For Multi-Vendor Infrastructure, if it's very high for one
    organization, that might be a sign that the project isn't as MVI
    as you thought.

    For Wide Open and Mass Market, this metric is not particularly
    relevant.  It could be high or it could be low, but it doesn't
    necessarily tell you much either way.

  \item Organizational diversity of responders.

    In Multi-Vendor Infrastructure, again watch out for one
    organization doing most of the responding.  One use of these
    metrics is to be able to tell a project -- perhaps a project that
    doesn't want to hear it -- that although they are aiming for MVI,
    they're actually B2B or something else.

    In Trusted Vendor, B2B, RStM, Specialty Library, expect low.

    In Wide Open, Mass Market, and Controlled Ecosystem, except high.

    In Upstream Dependency, not sure this metric tells us much.

  \item Diversity of participants and contributors along several axes:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Nationality (also, location --- not necessarily the same)
      \item Native language
      \item Profession
      \item Gender
      \item Ethnicity
      \item Paid contributor vs voluntary
    \end{itemize}

    These may be of special interest to Wide Open and Mass Market
    projects.  An argument --- or perhaps several distinct arguments,
    depending on the archetype --- can be made for their importance to
    other archetypes too.

  \item Number of interactions from a newcomer's arrival to them
    making a contribution (and thence to becoming a committer,
    perhaps); also, how many drop along the way and where.

    In a sense, this measures ``speed'' but with interactions instead
    of calendar time as the clock tick.  We define an interaction as
    participation in a distinct thread (including an issue tracker
    thread).

    The reason to measure by interaction instead of by calendar time
    is that the latter is likely to vary for reasons that are entirely
    about the individual and not about the project.  For example,
    someone who is busy and not focused on this project might only
    interact a few times per year while still eventually getting to
    the point of being a regular contributor, while someone who has
    more time or more motivation might do the same much more quickly.

    This \emph{may} be independent of archetype, and it may be the
    first of a whole class of metrics that are useable as signs of
    health but that don't necessarily correlate strongly with any
    particular archetype.  If so, we should probably have a dedicated
    subsection for such cross-archetype metrics.

\end{itemize}
