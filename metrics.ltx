\numberedsection{Signs of Health: Metrics and Archetypes}\label{metrics-archetypes}

The purpose of metrics, in the context of the archetypes, is to tell
you whether your investments are having the desired effect.

Metrics are only meaningful when you start from your goals.  What are
you trying to maximize, what is your investment so far, and are you
seeing the kinds of results you want?  It's rarely a question of ``Are
we doing a good job or a bad job?''.  Rather, it's ``How can we do a
better job?''

For example, your goal is to create an ecosystem that spans an
industry, with a Multi-Vendor Infrastructure project
(\ref{archetype:multi-vendor-infrastructure}), then an important
metric to watch is what companies are contributing to the project ---
not just who, but the frequency and depth of their involvement.

On the other hand, in a Wide Open project (\ref{archetype:wide-open})
with long-term stability as a key goal, then some signals of health
would diversity of contributors, reduction in onboarding time, rate of
non-employee contribution, etc.  And if one of your goals is to use
your open source involvement to develop a hiring pipeline for new
talent, that could affect how you approach onboarding: a broad shallow
pool may be good enough.  Broad and deep is even better of course --
but that takes more investment, which may or may not be worth it.

The goal of metrics is not to \emph{identify} the archetype --- an
archetype is as much a goal one sets as a reality one discovers ---
but to tell if the project is succeeding on its own terms.  A
secondary purpose is to get advance notice of forces that may cause
the project to evolve from one archetype to another.  If you're
expecting certain metrics, but seeing something different, it could
indicate that the project is transitioning to, or possibly from, some
other archetype.\footnote{See \fullref{transitions}.}  Whether this is
desirable or not depends on your goals.

Because archetypes overlap, and because a given metric usually applies
to multiple archetypes, we treat metrics as their own unified topic
here, rather than organizing them by archetype.  But for each
archetype, certain measurements warrant emphasis or special treatment,
and we will discuss those where applicable.

Some measurements to consider, in no particular order:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Ratio of one-off inquirers to repeat inquirers.

    For Mass Market, expect very high.

    For Wide Open, expect high.

    Review the others, and gather some data to see if this ratio
    differs as expected.  (Note: we could save negative-result
    hypotheses and maybe include them in an appendix or a separate
    document, instead of just removing them as though they were never
    there.)

  \item Duration of organizational participation, and ``weight'' per
    org.  Duration might need to be measured relative to market cycles.

    (B2B)

  \item Ratio of large change requests to small / one-off CRs.

    (B2B)

  \item Ratio of organizationally-motivated changes to
    individually-motivated ones.

    (B2B)

  \item Existence of customized forks / vendor branches.

    (B2B)

  \item Frequency of appearance as topic of conference presentations, hackathons?

    (B2B)

  \item Ratio of lead-org contributors to external contributors?

    (B2B and Multi-Vendor Infrastructure, but note that one should
    expect different ratios for those two different archetypes)

  \item Ubiquity of use within a defined industry area.

    (B2B)

  \item Packaging by OS distros; frequency of being offered as a
    pre-defined add-on by cloud vendors.

    (Multi-Vendor Infrastructure, maybe B2B)

  \item Migration of functionality from core to plugins (this is a
    special case of increasing modularization)

    (Controlled Ecosystem)

  \item Frequency with which a representative from the lead
    organization (``Benevolent Dictator Organization'' / ``BDO'')
    participates in discussion, especially with respect to discussions
    that lead toward a decision.  Look at both ratio across all
    discussions and ratio within each discussion thread.  By
    ``discussions'' here, we include issue tracker threads.

    For B2B, RStM, Upstream Dependency, and Trusted Vendor, this
    frequency should be high.

    For Controlled Ecosystem, same, but only w.r.t. core development,
    not plugins.

    For Multi-Vendor Infrastructure, if it's very high for one org,
    that might be a sign that the project isn't as MVI as you thought.

    For Wide Open and Mass Market, this metric is not particularly
    relevant.  It could be high or it could be low, but it doesn't
    necessarily tell you much either way.

  \item Organizational diversity of responders.

    In Multi-Vendor Infrastructure, again watch out for one org doing
    most of the responding.  One use of these metrics is to be able to
    tell a project -- perhaps a project that doesn't want to hear it
    -- that although they are aiming for MVI, they're actually B2B or
    something else.

    In Trusted Vendor, B2B, RStM, Specialty Library, expect low.

    In Wide Open, Mass Market, and Controlled Ecosystem, except high.

    In Upstream Dependency, not sure this metric tells us much.

  \item Engagement-level diversity of responders.

    (tbd: compare with above)

  \item Diversity of participants and contributors along several axes:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Nationality (also, location --- remember they're not the same)
      \item Native language
      \item Profession
      \item Gender
      \item Ethnicity
      \item ...tbd...
    \end{itemize}

    These may be of special interest to Wide Open and Mass Market
    projects.  An argument --- or perhaps several distinct arguments,
    depending on the archetype --- can be made for their importance to
    other archetypes too.

  \item Number of interactions from newcomer arrival to making a
    contribution (and thence to becoming a committer, perhaps), for
    those who do so.

    In a sense, this measures ``speed'', but using interactions as the
    clock tick instead of using calendar time.  We define an
    interaction as participation in a distinct thread (including an
    issue tracker thread).

    The reason to measure by interaction instead of calendar time is
    that the latter is likely to vary for reasons that are entirely
    about the individual and not about the project.  For example,
    someone who is busy and not focused on this project might only
    interact a few times per year while still eventually getting to
    the point of making a contribution, while someone who has more
    time or more motivation might do the same much more quickly.

    This \emph{may} be independent of archetype, and it may be the
    first of a whole class of metrics that are useable as signs of
    health but that don't necessarily correlate strongly with any
    particular archetype.  If so, we should probably have a dedicated
    subsection for such cross-archetype metrics.

\end{itemize}
