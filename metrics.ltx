\numberedsection{Signs of Health: Metrics and Archetypes}\label{metrics-archetypes}

\begin{center}\textit{Note: this section is in progress; expect it to change rapidly.}\end{center}

This section discusses how to measure various aspects of project
activity and project growth, and how those measurements should be
expected to differ by the type of project.  Because the archetypes
have so much in common with each other, and a given metric usually
applies to multiple archetypes, we treat metrics as their own unified
topic here rather than organizing them by archetype.  But for each
archetype, certain measurements warrant emphasis or special treatment,
and we will discuss those where applicable.

The goal of these metrics is not primarily to \emph{identify} the
archetype --- an archetype is as much a goal one sets as a reality one
discovers --- but to tell if the project is succeeding on its own
terms, and perhaps secondarily to get advance notice of forces that
may cause the project to evolve from one archetype to another.

(TBD: Connect with \fullref{transitions}: if you're expecting certain
metrics, and you see something slightly different from that, it could
indicate that the project is transitioning to (or possibly from) some
other archetype.  This might be desirable or might not be, but either
way the metrics can offer an early sign it's happening.)

These measurements are currently in no particular order:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Ratio of one-off inquirers to repeat inquirers.

    For Mass Market, expect very high.

    For Wide Open, expect high.

    Review the others, and gather some data to see if this ratio
    differs as expected.  (Note: we could save negative-result
    hypotheses and maybe include them in an appendix or a separate
    document, instead of just removing them as though they were never
    there.)

  \item Duration of organizational participation, and ``weight'' per
    org.  Duration might need to be measured relative to market cycles.

    (B2B)

  \item Ratio of large change requests to small / one-off CRs.

    (B2B)

  \item Ratio of organizationally-motivated changes to
    individually-motivated ones.

    (B2B)

  \item Existence of customized forks / vendor branches.

    (B2B)

  \item Frequency of appearance as topic of conference presentations, hackathons?

    (B2B)

  \item Ratio of lead-org contributors to external contributors?

    (B2B and Multi-Vendor Infrastructure, but note that one should
    expect different ratios for those two different archetypes)

  \item Ubiquity of use within a defined industry area.

    (B2B)

  \item Packaging by OS distros; frequency of being offered as a
    pre-defined add-on by cloud vendors.

    (Multi-Vendor Infrastructure, maybe B2B)

  \item Migration of functionality from core to plugins (this is a
    special case of increasing modularization)

    (Controlled Ecosystem)

  \item Frequency with which a representative from the lead
    organization (``Benevolent Dictator Organization'' / ``BDO'')
    participates in discussion, especially with respect to discussions
    that lead toward a decision.  Look at both ratio across all
    discussions and ratio within each discussion thread.  By
    ``discussions'' here, we include issue tracker threads.

    For B2B, RStM, Upstream Dependency, and Trusted Vendor, this
    frequency should be high.

    For Controlled Ecosystem, same, but only w.r.t. core development,
    not plugins.

    For Multi-Vendor Infrastructure, if it's very high for one org,
    that might be a sign that the project isn't as MVI as you thought.

    For Wide Open and Mass Market, this metric is not particularly
    relevant.  It could be high or it could be low, but it doesn't
    necessarily tell you much either way.

  \item Organizational diversity of responders.

    In Multi-Vendor Infrastructure, again watch out for one org doing
    most of the responding.  One use of these metrics is to be able to
    tell a project -- perhaps a project that doesn't want to hear it
    -- that although they are aiming for MVI, they're actually B2B or
    something else.

    In Trusted Vendor, B2B, RStM, Specialty Library, expect low.

    In Wide Open, Mass Market, and Controlled Ecosystem, except high.

    In Upstream Dependency, not sure this metric tells us much.

  \item Engagement-level diversity of responders.

    (tbd: compare with above)

  \item Diversity of participants and contributors along several axes:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Nationality (also, location --- remember they're not the same)
      \item Native language
      \item Profession
      \item Gender
      \item Ethnicity
      \item ...tbd...
    \end{itemize}

    These may be of special interest to Wide Open and Mass Market
    projects.  An argument --- or perhaps several distinct arguments,
    depending on the archetype --- can be made for their importance to
    other archetypes too.

  \item Number of interactions from newcomer arrival to making a
    contribution (and thence to becoming a committer, perhaps), for
    those who do so.

    In a sense, this measures ``speed'', but using interactions as the
    clock tick instead of using calendar time.  We define an
    interaction as participation in a distinct thread (including an
    issue tracker thread).

    The reason to measure by interaction instead of calendar time is
    that the latter is likely to vary for reasons that are entirely
    about the individual and not about the project.  For example,
    someone who is busy and not focused on this project might only
    interact a few times per year while still eventually getting to
    the point of making a contribution, while someone who has more
    time or more motivation might do the same much more quickly.

    This \emph{may} be independent of archetype, and it may be the
    first of a whole class of metrics that are useable as signs of
    health but that don't necessarily correlate strongly with any
    particular archetype.  If so, we should probably have a dedicated
    subsection for such cross-archetype metrics.

\end{itemize}
