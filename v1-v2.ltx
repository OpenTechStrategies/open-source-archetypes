\unnumberedsection{Changes from Version 1 to Version 2}\label{v1-v2-changes}

Readers of version 1 of the report may use this chart to find the
major new material in version 2.  Although most sections were touched
in the update, the changes to existing sections were generally not
major (the exception is the ``Archetypes at a Glance'' chart, which
was called ``Quick-Reference Chart'' in version 1 and has been
extensively revised here).  On the other hand, the new sections listed
below add whole new topics, and would be a natural place to start for
those who have already read the first version of this report.
