\unnumberedsection{Changes from Version 1 to Version 2}\label{v1-v2-changes}

Those familiar with version 1 of the report may use this table to find
the major new material in version 2.  Although most sections were
touched in the update, the changes to existing sections --- especially
the archetypes themselves --- were generally minor.\footnote{The
exception is \fullref{archetypes-at-a-glance} on
p. \pageref{archetypes-at-a-glance}, which was called
``Quick-Reference Chart'' in version 1.  It has been renamed and
extensively revised for version 2.}  Instead, we focused on providing
more information about how to \emph{use} the archetypes.  That
material is in the new sections listed below, so they would be a
natural place to start for those who have already read the first
version of this report.
