# Overview

"Open source" is a broad term that encompasses many different types of
projects.  There is a wide range of open source approaches, and
sometimes it helps to think through how your open source approach
matches your goals, resources, and environment.

We often see "open source project" used as a catch-all term to
describe very different projects that share only the fact that their
source code is distributed under an open source license.  We don't
have a common vocabulary to discuss open source development in ways
that take account of important differences between various types of
open source project.

This report is a first step in providing that common vocabulary.  OTS
prepared the first edition for Mozilla in the first half of 2018, and
the second edition in November 2019.  The report
catalogs a number of open source archetypes we have observed through
watching many projects over a couple of decades.  We have found these
archetypes to be a useful resource when crafting strategy, weighing
tradeoffs, and committing support to open source endeavors.

We hope it is useful to you as you design open source initiatives,
weigh tradeoffs in strategy, and pick metrics to track success.  The
archetypes we list are useful comparison points for anybody trying to
maximize the benefits of their open source investment.

# A Word of Caution

The boundaries between these archetypes are fuzzy.  One shouldn't
expect a real-world project to fit perfectly into exactly one
archetype.  The archetypes are not a taxonomy: a project may fit
multiple archetypes at once, and we had heated discussions on how to
characterize some projects.  Many successful projects change
archetypes over their lifecycle.

# How to Build the PDF

This report is written in
[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), and uses the [OTS
Doctools](https://code.librehq.com/ots/ots-doctools) system
to generate the PDF output.  Once you have the `ots-doctools`
infrastructure installed properly, running `make` should just work, if
you're on a Unix-like system that has GNU Make.  We don't have
experience building this document on Windows, but if you do, please let us know
how it goes and how we can improve these instructions.
